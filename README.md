# Multilingual-Adapter-for-SE

This repository contains code for paper "An Adapter for All Programming Languages? Adapter Tuning for Multilingual Tasks in Software Engineering". 


# How to use
We apply adapter tuning to code pre-trained models UniXcoder and CodeT5 for fine-tuning. 
  
  Please refer to the subdirectory of tasks for more details ([code summarization](https://github.com/wangdeze18/Multilingual-Adapter-for-SE/tree/main/code%20summarization) and [code search](https://github.com/wangdeze18/Multilingual-Adapter-for-SE/tree/main/code%20search/unixcoder)) !

 

# Datasets and Models 
**We also provide pre-trained models fine-tuned by our approach to verify the results.**

# Acknowledgement
Our implementation is adapted from [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE), [UniXcoder](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT/tree/master/UniXcoder), and [CodeT5](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5) for the implementation of pre-trained models.
