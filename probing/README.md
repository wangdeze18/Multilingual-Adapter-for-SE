# Probing experiments

The implementation is adapted from [probes](https://github.com/giganticode/probes). The environment can be easily constructed following their instructions.

The next step is to prepare various models, including the original model and the model with adapter, and then use the code here for probing. An example is shown in probe.sh.

Result_code_search.txt shows the probing results in the original paper.
